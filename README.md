## Motivation: 
The idea behind this project was to develop an effective system to detect to alert homeowners if a thief has entered their home.
## Features:
This home security system utilizes an ultrasonic, lidar, and photoresistor in conjuction with a capacitor to act as a light sensor. The ultrasonic sensor and lidar sensors were used to detect movement. The lidar sensor was used to detect movement that occurs from a much farther distance and the ultrasonic sensor was used to detect movement from a much closer distance. The light sensor was used to detect changes in light. If any change was discovered from any of the three sensors then the system will take a picture and send a notification to the user that something might have happened at their home.
## Code Description:
The code for this assignment can be found in the python file called AllSensors.py. The code for each of the individual sensors can be found inside this file as functions that will be continously called in a while loop.
